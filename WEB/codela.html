<p>CodeLagos is an initiative of the Lagos State Ministry of Education aimed at making coding education accessible to Lagos State residents.
 
 
 <br>
 <p>
<b> Why Teach Code?</b><br>
 
 As we strive towards an economy in which technology is leveraged to enhance the lives and promote the livelihoods of Lagos State residents, it is important to prepare our citizenry to meet new workforce demands, harness the benefits of technology, and communicate in the language of the future.
 
 <p>
 
<b> CodeLagos is positioning residents of Lagos State to</b><br>
 
 Approach the world of work as problem solvers
 Develop Innovative Solutions to local problems
 Meet the growing demand for tech skills
 Harness, create, and leverage on local & global opportunities

<li >CodeLagos kicked off in May 2017 with a pilot of 65 government and private schools across six education districts in Lagos State, and has since scaled up significantly. CodeLagos now runs in 648 schools across the State, teaching Scratch, Python and Oracle’s Alice and Greenfoot.</li>
 
 
 
<li> To advance our goal of making coding education accessible to 1,000,000 Lagosians, in November 2017, we began running CodeLagos classes in 4 Out-of-School coding centers at our public libraries and youth centres, catering to Lagos residents not currently within the school system. As of October 2018, we have scaled up to 39 Out-of-School coding centres. Our Out-of-School Program runs every 6-weeks, training participants in Python, Java, HTML Programming Languages and Blockchain Technology.</li>
 
 
 
<li >From the program’s inception, inclusiveness and equity have been of paramount importance, and we are pleased to count among our numbers a large percentage of women, students from low-income homes, individuals with physical challenges, and other underrepresented categories of learners.</li>
 
 
 
<li >A fundamental component of the initiative is human capital development. By teaching individuals to code, we empower them to become value-creating employees or job creators in any field they choose to pursue. This also pertains to our facilitators. There would be no CodeLagos program without our facilitators, most of whom are teachers from participating schools – who are deployed to deliver the training in both Government and private schools, as well as in out-of-school centres. Since its inception, CodeLagos has held 18 facilitator training sessions with over 1081 facilitators equipped with the knowledge and skills to train others to code.</li>
